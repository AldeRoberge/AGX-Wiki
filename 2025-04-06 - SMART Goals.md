Goals are smart :  
  
Specific  
Measurable  
Achievable / attainable / agreed-to  
Rewarding / relevant / realistic  
Time-based



Scope  
- Is project scope defined clearly enough to show when scope creep is occurring?  
- Does the project scope include related items that are out of scope?

To act on an issue, you have to be both :  
  
Aware, open minded, scruting, observing  
In a position to act, perform, change.  
  
Very often, we are in a position of awareness (of change, of pain) but in a position of powerlessness, incapable of acting. Anger frustration, lethargy.
