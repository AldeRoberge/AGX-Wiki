If you need to reference a project in the traditional way within the app host, set the `IsAspireProjectResource` attribute on the `ProjectReference` element to `false`, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\MyProject\MyProject.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
```

Otherwise, by default, the `ProjectReference` is treated as .NET Aspire project resource.
