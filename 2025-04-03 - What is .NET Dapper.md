**Dapper** is a lightweight, high-performance Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET. It is often considered a simpler and faster alternative to more full-featured ORMs like **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**. Dapper allows you to execute raw SQL queries and map the results directly to C# objects, offering a balance between the flexibility of raw SQL and the convenience of an ORM.

### **Key Features of Dapper**:

1. **Performance**: Dapper is extremely fast, often faster than EF Core or other ORMs, because it is a micro-ORM and doesn’t abstract away the SQL entirely. It operates with minimal overhead, which makes it a good choice for high-performance scenarios.
2. **Simple to Use**: Dapper is easy to integrate and use. It doesn't require the configuration and setup that more full-featured ORMs like EF Core do, making it ideal for projects that need lightweight and straightforward database interaction.
3. **Works with Raw SQL**: Dapper gives you full control over the SQL queries you execute, unlike more abstracted ORMs, which can sometimes make querying more complex.
4. **Flexible Mapping**: Dapper automatically maps query results to C# objects or lists of objects, and it can also handle complex scenarios such as multiple result sets, scalar values, and custom mappings.
5. **Supports Multiple Databases**: Dapper is database-agnostic and supports various relational databases, including SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, as long as you provide the correct connection string.

### **How Dapper Works**:

Dapper extends the functionality of `IDbConnection` to provide methods for querying and executing SQL commands. It uses **SQL query strings** and **parameterized queries** to interact with the database.

- **Querying**: It allows you to execute SQL queries and automatically map the results to strongly-typed C# objects.
- **Executing Commands**: You can execute SQL commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- **Transactions**: Dapper supports executing multiple commands within a transaction, which ensures consistency in operations.

### **Advantages of Dapper**:

- **Speed**: Dapper is one of the fastest ORMs, particularly when it comes to executing queries and fetching data.
- **Less Abstraction**: You write raw SQL queries, which provides full control over the SQL execution, and allows you to optimize performance as needed.
- **Minimal Overhead**: It has low memory usage and doesn't come with the complexities or additional features of larger ORMs like EF Core.

### **When to Use Dapper**:

- **Performance-Critical Applications**: If you're building high-performance applications where database interactions need to be as fast as possible.
- **Microservices or Small Projects**: When you want to keep things simple and don’t need the full capabilities of EF Core.
- **Raw SQL Queries**: If you need to write custom SQL queries, but still want an easy way to map results to C# objects.

### **Dapper Example**:

Let’s walk through a basic example to demonstrate how Dapper works in a .NET application.

1. **Install Dapper**: First, you need to install the Dapper NuGet package in your project:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Dapper
    ```
2. **Define the Database Connection**: Dapper works by extending the `IDbConnection` interface. You typically use `SqlConnection` for SQL Server.
3. **Example Code**:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using Dapper;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "YourDatabaseConnectionStringHere";
        
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();

            // Example: Query a single item
            var product = connection.QuerySingleOrDefault<Product>("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Id = @Id", new { Id = 1 });

            if (product != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Product: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}");
            }

            // Example: Query multiple items
            var products = connection.Query<Product>("SELECT * FROM Products").ToList();

            foreach (var p in products)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Product: {p.Name}, Price: {p.Price}");
            }

            // Example: Execute a command (e.g., Insert)
            string insertQuery = "INSERT INTO Products (Name, Price) VALUES (@Name, @Price)";
            int rowsAffected = connection.Execute(insertQuery, new { Name = "New Product", Price = 29.99 });

            Console.WriteLine($"{rowsAffected} rows inserted.");
        }
    }
}

// The Product class represents a row in the 'Products' table
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Querying Data**:
    - `QuerySingleOrDefault<Product>`: Executes the query and returns a single product object (or `null` if no result is found).
    - `Query<Product>`: Retrieves multiple product records and maps them to a list of `Product` objects.
2. **Executing Commands**:
    - `Execute`: Executes a command like an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` and returns the number of rows affected. This is useful for non-query operations.
3. **Parameterized Queries**:
    - Dapper supports parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and it automatically maps the parameters from an anonymous object (`new { Id = 1 }`).

### **Dapper vs EF Core**:
- **Dapper**:
    - Faster, especially for read-heavy scenarios and queries.
    - Directly uses raw SQL queries, giving you full control.
    - Simpler, with less overhead, but requires manual SQL handling.
- **EF Core**:
    - More feature-rich with built-in support for migrations, change tracking, and complex queries.
    - Higher overhead but offers more abstractions and ease of use for complex data models.
    - Best suited for applications that require a full ORM with LINQ support and features like lazy loading.

### **Summary**:

Dapper is ideal when you need simplicity, performance, and control over your SQL queries. It is commonly used for scenarios that require raw SQL or a lightweight ORM. On the other hand, if you need advanced features like change tracking, lazy loading, and automatic migrations, EF Core may be a better choice.
