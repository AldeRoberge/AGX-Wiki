So far, I have invested about 10 000$ of my own personal money. I would like to break even and be profitable. I have not taken any loan or external invester money.  
  
If I were to count the time required to learn programmation, unity, server programming, fmod, GitHub, clickup, which I estimate to be about 20 000 hours, with a salary of 20$ per hour, I would be at about x. But I did not pay myself a salary.
