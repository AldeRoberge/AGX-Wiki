Project management is inherently complex. It involves tracking multiple tasks and their properties such as progression, difficulty, and team assignment while ensuring efficiency and clarity. As of march 17 2025, we evaluated the possible options to ensure our choice is still the best.

### Why I'm reconsidering ClickUp
I have found ClickUp to sometimes underperform in speed and user-friendliness. It has certainly improved in speed during my first use in 2021, but remains bulky.

The subreddit [/r/clickup](https://www.reddit.com/r/clickup/comments/1izmmjw/warning_for_anyone_evaluating_clickup/) has multiple warnings from users complaining : 
* "Move on, if you still can. ClickUp is a disaster.", we can read [on the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/clickup/comments/167cnqn/comment/jyr4819/).
* "And the app is so buggy and lags all the time in the CRM", we can [also](https://www.reddit.com/r/clickup/comments/1irb4xq/new_pricing_is_insane/) read.
* "The consensus is that itâ€™s a pain to use and highly unintuitive.", [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/clickup/comments/1ec1xh7/comment/lf12lif/) user mentions.
*  "no option to turn off the AI-bullshit" mentions [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/clickup/comments/1ec1xh7/comment/lf3p28h/) user.

### Discarded Solutions

There are 3 project management software I never heard of, Huly, Fibery, Linear and Meegle :
### Huly
1. ðŸ”´ I find the left side panel confusing. Icons-only is slow to parse. I hate Icon-only UI navigation.
2. ðŸ”´ It also has a weird two step process of Planning and then Tracking tasks.
3. ðŸ”´ I find the UI all over the place, it's sparse, disproportionate at places. 
4. ðŸ”´ It has limited views (only List and Kanban)
5. ðŸŸ¢ It does have a builtin chat
### Fibery
1. ðŸŸ¢ Seems very dynamic, with the use of Notion-like databases
2. ðŸŸ¢ Very modular
3. ðŸ”´ Can be VERY confusing, feels like a "build your own project management software"
### Linear
1. ðŸ”´ Navigation is confusing
2. ðŸ”´ Feels like a dumber ClickUp
#### Meegle
1. ðŸŸ¢ I like the welcome 'My Work' screen
2. ðŸ”´ While I like the clean minimalist view, it's a bit hard to navigate
#### Motion
1. ðŸ”´ Too expensive.

#### appflowy
1. ðŸ”´ The name is cringe (what's with the -y trend? What's 'appflow' anyway.)
2. ðŸŸ¢ Open Source

#### Outline
1. Needs further testing

## Addressing Potential Risks

When selecting a project management tool, several risks must be considered:

### Vendor Lock-In

While many tools offer robust features, the risk of vendor lock-in remains. It's crucial to verify whether the tool allows regular data exports and supports data migration in case a switch becomes necessary. Users should always ensure that their data can be easily transferred to avoid dependency on a single vendor.

### Platform Stability

All software platforms run the risk of experiencing crashes or data corruption. Regular backups and data export options are essential for mitigating these risks. Itâ€™s advisable to review each platform's track record for stability and to monitor user feedback regarding any recurrent issues.

### Evolving Service Quality

Changes in service quality can occur over time, particularly in rapidly evolving, venture-backed platforms. Users should be aware of the potential for shifts in customer support, feature availability, and overall performance. Keeping an eye on industry news and user reviews can provide insights into whether a tool continues to meet expectations.

## Conclusion

After carefully evaluating multiple project management tools based on speed, usability, cost-effectiveness, and essential features, **ClickUp** emerges as the strongest contender for structured and performance-driven workflows. Its cost, intuitive interface (once mastered), and robust workflow management make it a great choice, especially for development teams.

On the other hand, **Huly** presents a promising option for those seeking a lightweight, cost-effective solution. While it still lacks mobile and desktop support, its speed and simplicity could make it a future contender as it matures.
