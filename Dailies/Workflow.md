## Roadmap & Milestones

A **roadmap** is a strategic plan that lists the **milestones** to be achieved throughout the development cycle. Each milestone represents a significant step towards completing a larger goal. Milestones consist of a series of **tasks** that need to be completed in order to meet our objectives. We keep it super simple without extra fluff. We believe that less is more, basic is good, transparent, clear and direct.

### Key Components:

- **Milestones:** Represent significant goals that define the major phases of development.
- **Tasks:** Subdivisions of milestones that involve specific actions or objectives to be completed. These tasks are broken down into manageable chunks of work for development teams.

### Process:

- **Planning:** At the start of each development phase, the team creates a roadmap with defined milestones. Each milestone has specific tasks, deliverables, and deadlines to follow.
- **Execution:** Once the roadmap is set, the team begins working on tasks associated with each milestone.
- **Review:** At regular intervals, the progress towards each milestone is reviewed. Adjustments are made as necessary to keep the development on track.

## 2. Testing and Feedback

Testing is an integral part of our workflow, ensuring that each feature or update meets the required standards before release. This step involves actively engaging with **internal testers** and the community to gather **feedback** and make improvements.

### Testing Phases:

- **Alpha Testing:** Internal testing to verify new features, systems, and mechanics. This phase focuses on debugging and balancing.
- **Beta Testing:** Public or closed beta phases where we allow a select group of players to test the game in a live environment. This provides us with valuable insights into the player experience, as well as any technical issues that may arise.
- **Ongoing Testing:** Even after the initial release, we continue testing new features, patches, and optimizations regularly.

### Feedback Collection:

- **Player Feedback:** During beta testing and after updates, we actively gather feedback from players through surveys, direct communication, and social media.
- **Internal Feedback:** Our development team conducts regular reviews and internal testing to provide feedback on new features and systems.

### Improvements:

- Based on the feedback received, features are adjusted, bugs are fixed, and the gameplay experience is continuously refined.
- We prioritize high-impact changes that will significantly improve player engagement and game stability.

## 3. Community Communication

Transparency is key to maintaining a strong relationship with our community. We ensure that our players are always up to date with the latest developments and are aware of upcoming features.

### Updates & Announcements:

- **Official Discord:** We use our official Discord channel to communicate directly with players, provide real-time updates, and gather feedback. It's also a space for players to report bugs, ask questions, and engage with developers.
- **Social Media:** We post regular updates on our official social media platforms, keeping the community informed about the latest patches, milestones, and announcements.
- **Patch Notes:** For each update, we release detailed patch notes outlining the changes, bug fixes, and improvements made in the game.

### Key Benefits:

- **Transparency:** Players are kept in the loop about what’s coming next, what’s been fixed, and any major milestones that have been reached.
- **Engagement:** Social media and Discord provide direct channels for players to voice their opinions, share feedback, and become a part of the development process.
- **Trust:** Regular communication fosters a sense of community and trust, making players feel involved and valued.
