Data travels in wires, streams, flux, tunnels, way, channels, paths, circuits and roads. These roads help to guide the traffic flow from point A to Z.


### Directionality

Unidirectional stream, such as rivers, one way roads, limit the traffic to a specific direction.
Bidirectional streams, such as two way roads, allow traffic to flow inward and outward.


### Isolation

Isolation is the property of a stream in which its [[internal and external]] components are not interfering, thus not [[modified]]. Think of a river not overflowing to nearby houses, electricity wires not shocking its users, or cars on the freeway getting [[Hit or Miss]] by incoming traffic.
