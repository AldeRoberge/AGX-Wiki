## Abstraction

Abstraction is a core principle of knowledge and understanding. 
It is the process in which the brain understand the world.

The process of abstraction allows us to learn and use higher level representation.

Abstraction is seen as a spectrum, from generic to specific. We see generic as large, unified, and specific as small, detailed.

Specific data, such as a binary stream, can be decoded into an audio format, which in turn can be played on speakers, which in turn can be heard by human ears, which in turn will be understood by the brain, relating to higher concepts, defined by the characteristics.

Abstraction is always a lossy conversion, as some specific data is lost or modified along [[Streams, Tunnels and Roads]].
