The [status page](https://status.aliengarden.com/status/main) uses [Uptime-Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/), an awesome open source status page from the same creator as [Dockge](https://github.com/louislam/dockge).


After installing Uptime-Kuma, we :

* Add links to all of the required services (wiki, test and prod servers)
* Make the status page the default page in the Uptime-Kuma settings
* Add an icon to the Status page
