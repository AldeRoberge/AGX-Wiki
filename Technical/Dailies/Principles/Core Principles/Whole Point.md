# One
A single whole point is an [[Concrete vs. Abstract]] of a position in space and time. While itself can be [[infinitly]] complex, it usually this highest (and lowest) point of abstraction we can pinpoint a property. 

A single infinity is inmeasurable, but it has a sementinc meaning which we can attribute to a single point.

A point is neither indivisible (it can be divised infinitly) nor divisible (divising it breaks its inherent meaning).

Points are concepts, entities, components and actors, space and time. They are the content of boundaries we defined around and something we can point a finger to.

When two points act as One, they are acting as a Couple, Duo.



### Orbiting 
When a point is turning around (cycling) another one, we say it's orbiting
