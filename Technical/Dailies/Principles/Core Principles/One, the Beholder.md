A Beholder is a being, is one of the two absolute truths.

It can perceive itself as being (I think therefore I am).
And it can perceive [[Zero, the Nothingness|nothingness]], the absence of being. It is precisely this perception of not being that allows it to be, otherwise it would be in a static, frozen, solid state which exactly zero perception would be. A beholder is a thinker, for beholding is the active state of thinking about what is perceived.

In other words, fundamentally, thinking is to be is to think, since you can "be" or "behold" but not think, which would not mean anything anyway.

The Beholder, from it's point of view, is the only thing there is, so it is **everything**. 

The beholder is not necessarly human, for a sufficiently advanced organism (biological or digital) has the capacity to behold, think and act.


# A point of View
From it's position in space/time, the beholder receives information from which it can construct its understanding (thinking). This point of view is limited by the quality and quantity of information received and processed. The quality of the point of view greatly changes the perspective and thinking.

## Multiple Beholders
When multiple beholders coexist, they each independently experience the other beings as being both part of themselves (togetherness), and being independent (alone). 



# To Construct an Universe

To construct this beholder, we must at least have : 

* A space (two dimensions is enough, one for time and the other for the state)
* A set of rules (quantum or traditionnal), that define the thinking of the behavior

These state transitions can manifest in many ways : 
* Turing's Machine
*  Finite State Machines
*  Cellular Automato (e.g. Conways Game of Life)
* Counter Machines




Who wrote the program? Why does the universe have to have laws at all?
