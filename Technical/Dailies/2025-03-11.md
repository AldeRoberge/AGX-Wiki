--- On the state of AI in programming  
  
There is a lot of discussion about AI replacing programmers in the future. I think it's a actually a very good idea to automate most of the boilerplate, repetitive and non creative tasks of software programming.  
  
Especially with how open source warriors are closely following behind tech giants like OpenAI, I feel like the control of these incredible technologies will be in good hands.  
  
I am personally very happy that the entry to programming will be lowered, since this means that newcomers won't have to struggle as much as I did. A lot of problems can be solved using AI in combination with programming.  
  
--- Utopic project planning  
  
Deadlines (time limits for goals)  
Projects (clearly defined work of areas) to work towards goals  
Break those tasks into chunks  
  
From left (tasks) combined into right (project). Some kind of mind map, visual graph.  
  
I have to downsize a lot of projects, since their scope is immense, and I'm alone without any budget.
