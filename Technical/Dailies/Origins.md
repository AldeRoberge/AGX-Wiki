Alien Garden started as a concept in 2019. It evolved many times and eventually we settled on using a beloved defunct project by the makers of Darza's Dominion and Born Again, called [**Trials of Titan**](https://github.com/Unnamed-Studios-LLC/Trials-Of-Titan). Juix, the maker of ToT, published his source code on GitHub with the MIT license. I used this code to learn about game design, programming and everything else.


We migrated a good chunk of the Unity client code to use URP, better, cleaner code structure and modern standards. 

We also updated a good chunk of the game server code, which resides in a separate solution.
