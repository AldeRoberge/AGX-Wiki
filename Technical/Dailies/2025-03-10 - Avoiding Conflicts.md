**Resolving a Conflict**

1. **Identify and understand the problem**
    - Listen attentively, be open-minded, and show empathy
    - Create an environment that encourages freedom of expression (communication with no consequences)
    - Promote respect (for people, viewpoints, and personal spaces)
    - Show emotional intelligence and let common sense speak for itself
2. **Find solutions and apply them**
    - Through negotiation (when the context allows):
        - Right timing, place, and mindset
        - Enough time to reflect, “decompress”
        - Favor solutions that improve the situation for everyone
    - Through imposition (when the context demands it)

**Direct Resolution Strategies**

- **Problem-solving**  
    Seek mutual satisfaction by directly addressing the causes of the conflict  
    Identify the problem and find a solution where all parties are satisfied
- **Accommodation**  
    Yield to the opposing party  
    Smooth over differences to maintain superficial harmony
- **Avoidance**  
    Minimize the differences  
    Sidestep the problem  
    Withdraw or show unwavering neutrality
- **Compromise**  
    Ensure each party is partially satisfied  
    Seek acceptable rather than optimal solutions, ensuring that no one loses or is fully satisfied
- **Confrontation or Constraint**  
    Actively oppose the other party’s will  
    Attempt to dominate the situation in a win-lose relationship or impose the preferred solution through authority
