#### How to edit the Wiki layout and style

> [!warning] Advanced users
> 
> Editing the layout is not necessary to make changes to the content of the wiki. Edit the layout and style if you need a custom look and feel for the website.

To edit the Wiki style, you must clone the [AGX-Wiki-Quartz](https://github.com/AldeRoberge/AGX-Wiki-Quartz) repository. 

It contains a fork of Quartz 4 which has had various changes, including but not limited to the icon, position of the dark mode button, footer text, and the font has been changed to [Lexend](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend).

To learn how to customize the layout, you can read the excellent Quartz [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/layout) (which itself is published using Quartz).
