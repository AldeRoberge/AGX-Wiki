> This guide is meant for users interested in the process of editing and publishing the wiki. To contribute changes, we accept pull requests on the [AGX-Wiki](https://github.com/AldeRoberge/AGX-Wiki) GitHub.

The [AGX-Wiki](https://wiki.aliengarden.com/) is a collection of notes edited in Obsidian. 

These notes are then converted into a static website using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). 

To change the font, icon and style, we use a customized fork of Quartz ([AGX-Wiki-Quartz](https://github.com/AldeRoberge/AGX-Wiki-Quartz)).

The process of building and publishing the pages as a website is automated on Docker and Dockge.

*  [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) (or any [git](https://git-scm.com/) client) to clone the repositories and publish changes.
