To publish your content or layout and style changes, we use a combination of Docker images and Dockge, a fancy pants *docker-compose.yml* editor, so we can easily update the generated website.




#### Server Required
Before starting, ensure you have a VPS. You can buy one from [Hostinger](https://www.hetzner.com/), [Hetzner](https://www.hostinger.com/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), or any cloud provider. You can always [host your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/). I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 on [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/), which costs me about 5$ per month.




#### Install Dockge
If this is your first time running this, follow [these steps](https://github.com/louislam/dockge?tab=readme-ov-file#basic) to install Dockge on your machine.
