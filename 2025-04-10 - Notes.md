Starting now, I would like to ensure that the code is perfect before continuing.


I wouldn't call MudBlazor much exciting. It looks terribly dated, and all of the websites using it are in a foreign language or don't work.

As for SyncFusion, it looks awesome but it's non-open source nature is a little scary, and it makes me uneasy.
