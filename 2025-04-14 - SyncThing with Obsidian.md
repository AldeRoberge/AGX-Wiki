I think I should not only use Git to track my changes in Obsidian, but also use SyncThing to provide automatic fast updates. Right now there is a lot of issues coming from slow git pull and push.

I'm not sure on how to use SyncThing, but I'm doing my research now.

Synthing is : 

* Free and open source
* End-to-end encrypted
* No centeral server : — it’s P2P (peer-to-peer).


### 💡 Tips & Tricks

- 🕐 **Versioning**: You can enable file versioning to keep old versions
- 📶 **LAN-only Sync**: You can force it to sync only on the local network (good for privacy).
- 🌐 **Global Discovery**: By default, Syncthing can find devices over the internet too.
- 🚫 **Ignore Patterns**: Add `.stignore` files to exclude files/folders (like `.gitignore`).

There is [SyncthingTray](https://martchus.github.io/syncthingtray/), which now replaces the defunct [SyncTrayzor](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor).
