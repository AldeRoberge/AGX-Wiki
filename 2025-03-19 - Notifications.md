In line with the framework embraced by [[Quests]] and [[Achievements]], the notification system operates through orchestrated [[Events]], actively apprising players of pertinent occurrences within their virtual realm.

**Players are promptly notified of significant in-game events, with the ability to review and dismiss these alerts.**

- Notifications are swiftly disseminated through real-time server broadcasts, subsequently archived in the database for reference.
- Certain pivotal notifications transcend the in-game sphere, extending to Discord for broader community awareness.
- As players initiate the game, notifications are seamlessly retrieved to ensure they're up-to-date from the moment of engagement.
- Empowering players, the "notifclear" command stands ready, granting them the agency to dismiss notifications at will.
