ChatGPT has a tendency to write in a certain way that can be spotted by aware users. I have noted here some giveaways that tell me that something is written by ChatGPT, ranging from most annoying to least.

| **Clue**                        | **Description**                                                  | **Example**                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forced Quirkiness**           | Tries to be playful or quirky when it’s out of place.            | "Let’s embark on a wild ride into the depths of computer programming!" (in a technical article)                                                            |
| **Overly Complex Descriptions** | AI overcomplicates simple ideas.                                 | "This isn’t merely a small problem; it is a highly intricate and multifaceted challenge that demands immediate attention."                                 |
| **Lack of Personal Touch**      | Lacks emotion, real personal stories, or distinct human insight. | "Many people find happiness in traveling, but it can be exhausting, and it is often best to choose your destinations wisely."                              |
| **Clichés and Filler**          | Uses overused phrases to fill space.                             | "At the end of the day, the results will speak for themselves."                                                                                            |
| **Redundant Conclusions**       | Repeats key points in the conclusion, making it feel mechanical. | "In conclusion, the internet has transformed communication. It has revolutionized how we interact, as it plays a significant role in communication today." |
| **Excessive Nuance**            | Avoids strong opinions, preferring overly neutral language.      | "While some might argue that social media is damaging, others may suggest it’s beneficial in certain contexts."                                            |
| **Generic Responses**           | Sticks to safe, broad statements without specific examples.      | "Technology is a crucial part of modern life, influencing nearly every aspect of society."                                                                 |
