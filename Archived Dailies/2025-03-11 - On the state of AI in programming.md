There’s a lot of talk about AI replacing programmers. Honestly, I think automating the repetitive, boilerplate parts of programming is a great idea. It frees up developers to focus on the creative, problem-solving side of coding instead of wasting time on busywork.

With open-source developers keeping up with tech giants like OpenAI, I’m not worried about control falling into the wrong hands. This technology will be widely accessible, and that’s a good thing.

I’m also glad that AI will lower the barrier to entry for programming. Newcomers won’t have to struggle as much as I did, and more people will be able to build great things by combining AI with programming.
