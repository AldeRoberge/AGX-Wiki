**AGX** is the *tag line*, which defines the primary scope of what this project tries to do : 
* **Keyword**: Text
* **Keyword**: Text
* **Keyword**: Text
Aditionally, progress is also happening to provide the following core capabilities:
* **Keyword**: -
* **Keyword:** -

Defining the scope is important for the success of any project:

- A scope too broad will result in development effort spreading too thin and will run into danger that this project tries to do too many things and none of them well.
- A scope too narrow will make this project uninteresting and will exclude audiences that could also benefit from this project.
- Not defining a scope will easily lead to misunderstandings and false hopes of where this project tries to go.

Of course, this is subject to change: The scope can be expanded as this project continues to grow and more people contribute.
