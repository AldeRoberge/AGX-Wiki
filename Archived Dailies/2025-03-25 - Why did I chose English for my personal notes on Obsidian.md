I write my personal notes in English for several reasons. It helps me think more clearly and keeps things concise. Most of my research is in English, so it just makes sense to take notes in the same language.

Writing in English also helps me improve my language skills, and it’s easier to share my notes with others who use English. Over time, it’s just become a habit, and now it feels like the most natural way to organize my thoughts.

And no, this isn’t a hot take : English is the go-to language for pretty much everything—research, work, communication.

However, let me be clear: writing my personal notes in English does not diminish my commitment to the preservation of Québec French. As a language in decline, Québec French requires our collective effort to ensure its survival. I hold it in the highest regard—it's not just a linguistic tool but a vital part of our cultural heritage. Rest assured, any product I create will feature Québec French, as it is essential that we protect and promote this language for future generations. It is not merely about communication; it is about safeguarding an identity.
