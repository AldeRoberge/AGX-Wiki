### Why I stopped organising my notes into folders

Taking notes in Obsidian starts with good intentions—sorting them into folders, creating hierarchies, and designing a perfect system. But soon, the system collapses under its own weight. The more notes you accumulate, the harder it becomes to decide where each one belongs. A single note could fit into multiple categories, leading to endless reorganizations, duplicated content, and wasted time.
### There's no perfect structure

I’ve abandoned the illusion of perfect structure. Instead of forcing notes into rigid folders, I now organize them chronologically—grouped by when they were written. This simple shift eliminates decision fatigue and allows me to focus on writing, not filing.
### Lost between all the note taking apps

Before standardizing my workflow in Obsidian, I was lost between Google Docs, Obsidian, Google Keep, and ClickUp Docs. My notes were scattered—some detailed, some just fragments of thoughts—but all of them mattered. Trying to keep track of everything across multiple platforms was overwhelming. By consolidating everything into Obsidian, I’ve gained clarity and control over my notes, regardless of their level of completeness.
### The problem with Folders 

The problem with folders is that they force a unidimensional structure onto something inherently complex. A single note might belong to multiple topics, yet folders demand it exist in only one place. Nesting notes only makes this worse—burying information deep within layers of hierarchy makes retrieval slower and less intuitive. The reality is that knowledge isn’t linear; it’s interconnected. Folders create artificial boundaries that hinder rather than help.

The reality is that knowledge isn’t linear; it’s interconnected, more like a vector database than a rigid file system. Your brain doesn’t store information in deeply nested directories—it forms a web of associations, allowing ideas to be retrieved from multiple contexts. Folders create artificial boundaries that hinder rather than help.

Retrieval is no longer an issue, thanks to tags and Obsidian’s powerful search. Tags offer flexibility, enabling dynamic connections between notes without the constraints of folders. Need all notes related to a project, concept, or theme? A quick tag search surfaces everything instantly.
### Stop wasting so much time trying to sort your notes

This approach has transformed my workflow. No more second-guessing where a note belongs—just pure, uninterrupted thinking. Notes should serve creativity, not bureaucracy. And in Obsidian, less structure often leads to more clarity.

>[!warning] In short...
>Just write those notes. Put down your thoughts on the paper. Everything will be there when you come back. Don't sort those notes. Just put them in the big drawer, and you'll be able to search for them using keywords. Don't constantly rewrite them. The past is imperfect. The future is unknown.
