> You must **choose**. Stop trying to be great at everything. Be _exceptional_ at one thing.

I tried the [[2025-04-03 - ChatGPT Prompt]], which is pretty fun. It says some interesting, albeit generic, motivational things.

> You should be building audience leverage NOW, not after you have a finished product.

Which is true. Which is also paradoxical. But we see this very often now : Marketing without a real product behind it. I think there's a great balance to be had : hype versus product.

> Cut **at least** 3 projects or commitments that are diluting your focus and energy.

The thing is, I can't really cut commitments. They are mostly all essential.

> You need to stabilize, regain control, and get **small, consistent wins**. That’s how you climb out.

Well said. Generic, nothing brand new, but it's the truth.

> Fix your energy levels. Non-negotiables: **Sunlight, movement, and sleep.**

Hard to get sunlight in this godforsaken northen city.

>Your goal is _momentum_, not _perfection_. Speed **kills self-doubt**.

True.

> Cut the deadweight: doomscrolling, passive entertainment, anything that doesn’t actively recharge you or push you forward.

True. Doomscrolling is a terrible plague. I like the concept of eliminating anything that doesn't "recharge" and "push you forward".

> Stop thinking about _shipping something massive_. Start with something **tiny** but finished.

True.

> Sleep properly (cut screens at night, strict schedule).
> Move every day (even just a walk).
> Break your routine (change environment, talk to new people, disrupt autopilot mode).

Also true. I have a big problem with nighttime screen time. Plugging my cellphone far away is a solution I found. I do move every day, to get to my job. I do not break my routine much.
