Synchronization is the process by which two or more components coordinate their time-dependent operations to occur simultaneously or in a predictable sequence. When components operate in this coordinated fashion, they are said to be "in sync"; if they do not, they are considered "desynchronized" or "out of sync."

**Examples of Synchronized Systems:**

- **Technological Devices:**
    - Devices such as watches, clocks, and computers rely on internal clocks to ensure that their operations are precisely coordinated.
- **Natural Phenomena:**
    - Some species of fireflies synchronize their flashing patterns as part of their natural behavior.

**Example of a Desynchronized Process:**

- **Email Communication:**
    - Unlike systems designed for real-time coordination, email communication can result in responses that are nearly instantaneous or significantly delayed, leading to a lack of predictable timing.

The effectiveness of synchronization depends on the specific time scales and requirements of the system, making it a variable quality across different applications.
