### Structured vs Unstructured

A group that is structured, is constructive, unified, united, strong, hard, stable and ordered.
A group that is unstructured, is destructive, borken, divised, weak, soft, unstable.

### Common vs Uncommon

If these groups include different parts, we define the special parts as uncommon.

When this special different component is unwanted, we say that the group is unpire, contaminated. When the group is pure, we say that's it's homogenic.

The difference can be : 
* **Washed** (Clean)
* **Accepted** (As is)
* **Integrated** (Transformed)
### Ressources
When a group of objects have value, they are labelled as a resource. Accessibility to these ressources are always a challenge among a [[Actor|population]]. We characterise the collection, space, room, [[Space, Terrain and Territory|space]] as being :

When a provider of a resource is benevolent, we call it a provider. 

Ressources can be : 
* Exchanged (Traded)
* Gifted
* Lended
* Sold
* Stolen
