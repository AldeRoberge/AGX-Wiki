By Tim Ferriss's "[I suck at efficiency](https://www.facebook.com/TimFerriss/posts/pfbid02mK8rErjH6CChL37gKagVbhaowskNCKD6e23YnCrSWRspADZFMCPfxgQg7D9GdAAQl)" on Facebook

1. Wake up at least one hour before you have to be at a computer screen. Email is the mind killer.
2. Make a cup of tea (or coffee) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.
3. Write down the 3-5 things—and no more—that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They're often things that have been punted from one day's to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually = most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict.
4. For each item, ask yourself:
    1. If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?
    2. Will moving this forward make all the other to-dos unimportant or easier to knock off later?
5. Look only at the items you've answered "yes" to for at least one of these questions.
6. Block out at least 2-3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.
7. TO BE CLEAR: Block out at least 2-3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does NOT work.
8. If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don't freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.

Congratulations! That's it.

This is the only way I can create big outcomes despite my never-ending impulse to procrastinate, nap, and otherwise fritter away my days with bullshit.

If I have 10 important things to do in a day, it's 100% certain nothing important will get done that day. On the other hand, I can usually handle 1 must-do item and block out my lesser behaviors for 2-3 hours a day.

### Personal Notes

This article offers a great generalization in how to avoid procrastination when tasks pile up. To me, it's an easy read and a great introduction into self help for people who have tendencies to have trouble with prioritizing tasks and concentration.
