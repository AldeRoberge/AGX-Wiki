**FastEndpoints** is a minimalistic, high-performance framework for building RESTful APIs in **.NET**. It is designed to simplify the process of creating APIs by providing a clean and easy-to-use syntax, reducing the overhead typically found in traditional ASP.NET Core controllers. **FastEndpoints** allows you to focus more on the logic of your application while abstracting away much of the boilerplate code required by other frameworks.

### **Key Features of FastEndpoints**:

- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Reduces the need for verbose controller classes and action methods.
- **Performance**: Built for high-performance APIs with minimal overhead.
- **Fluent API Design**: Allows you to define routes and endpoints in a clean and concise manner.
- **Request Validation**: Built-in support for model validation, including automatic 400 error responses when validation fails.
- **Dependency Injection**: Supports DI for services and dependencies in endpoints.
- **Async Support**: Natively supports asynchronous operations, making it ideal for modern APIs.
- **Built-in Documentation**: Easily integrates with Swagger for auto-generating API documentation.
### **Use Case**:

- **Building REST APIs** quickly with minimal configuration.
- **Microservices** or **serverless architectures** where lightweight, performant APIs are needed.

### **Example Usage**:

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use FastEndpoints in a .NET application:

1. **Install the FastEndpoints NuGet Package**:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package FastEndpoints
    ```
2. **Create a FastEndpoint**:
```csharp
using FastEndpoints;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public class Product // Define the request model
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Define the endpoint
public class CreateProductEndpoint : Endpoint<Product>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/products");  // Define the HTTP method and route
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(Product request)
    {
        // Simulate saving the product (e.g., to a database)
        await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate some async work
        await SendOkAsync(new { Message = "Product created successfully!", Product = request });
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

        // Register FastEndpoints services
        builder.Services.AddFastEndpoints();

        var app = builder.Build();

        // Map the FastEndpoints
        app.MapFastEndpoints();

        app.Run();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Define the Request Model**:
    - `Product` represents the data structure for the API request. You send an object of this type in a `POST` request to create a new product.
2. **Create an Endpoint**:
    - The `CreateProductEndpoint` class defines a POST endpoint to handle requests to create products.
    - It inherits from `Endpoint<Product>`, and in the `Configure` method, we define the HTTP method (`Post`) and route (`/products`).
    - In the `HandleAsync` method, the business logic (e.g., saving the product) is implemented, and a response is sent back.
3. **Setup FastEndpoints**:
    - In the `Program` class, we configure FastEndpoints by calling `AddFastEndpoints` to register services and `MapFastEndpoints` to map the endpoints.

### **Run the Application**:

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    
2. The endpoint will be available at `POST http://localhost:5000/products`.
    - Send a `POST` request with a JSON body like:
        
        ```json
        {
            "Name": "Laptop",
            "Price": 999.99
        }
        ```
        
3. You will receive a response like:
    
    ```json
    {
        "Message": "Product created successfully!",
        "Product": {
            "Name": "Laptop",
            "Price": 999.99
        }
    }
    ```

### **Why Use FastEndpoints**:

- **Simplicity**: It minimizes the amount of code you need to write, making the API development process faster and easier.
- **Performance**: FastEndpoints is optimized for speed and is ideal for high-performance applications.
- **Maintainability**: With reduced boilerplate, the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.

### **Integrating FastEndpoints with Swagger**:

FastEndpoints integrates well with Swagger for automatic API documentation generation. If you’re using Swashbuckle for Swagger, just add the following:

1. **Install the Swashbuckle NuGet Package**:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
    ```
    
2. **Modify the `Program` class to include Swagger**:
    

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();
```

Now, when you run the application, you can navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger` to see your API documentation generated automatically.
