Just when I was about designing my project around MassTransit, it [goes commercial](https://masstransit.io/introduction/v9-announcement). This shift has been hapenning in a lot of open source librairies, like FluentAssertions, [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/discussions/1105), etc.

Non exhaustive list of librairies that were open source and are now commercial : 
> IdentityServer, ImageSharp, FluentAssertions, MediatR, AutoMapper, MassTransit

This shift from open to commercial is worrying. I am a hobbist. I don't make money, in fact, I lose it.

MassTransit will stop supporting MassTransit v8, it's last open source ersion, after 2026.

What the fuck.

> Will the v9 code be open source? "Probably."

Worrying.

Reddit users are worrying that Polly and Dapper might follow the same plan.

True.
