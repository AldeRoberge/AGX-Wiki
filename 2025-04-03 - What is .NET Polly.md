**Polly** is a popular .NET library for handling **resilience and transient fault handling**. It allows developers to write policies for retrying, circuit breaking, timeout handling, and bulkhead isolation, making applications more robust and fault-tolerant. It is typically used in scenarios where operations might fail intermittently, such as network requests, database calls, or external service calls.

### **Key Features of Polly**:

1. **Retry Policies**: Automatically retries a failed operation, often with exponential backoff or a fixed interval.
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents an application from making repeated failing calls by "breaking" the circuit after a certain number of failures, and then allowing the system to recover after a specified timeout.
3. **Timeouts**: Defines a time window after which a request will be considered failed if it hasn't completed.
4. **Bulkhead Isolation**: Limits the number of simultaneous executions of a particular operation, effectively creating a pool of resources that prevents overwhelming systems.
5. **Fallback**: Defines an alternative action or response when the primary operation fails (such as returning a cached result or a default value).
6. **Policy Combinations**: Policies can be combined together to form complex workflows. For example, retry policies can be combined with circuit breakers or fallback policies to create a robust and fault-tolerant system.
    

### **Common Use Cases**:

- **HTTP Requests**: When calling external APIs that might be temporarily unavailable.
- **Database Operations**: In cases where database queries might fail temporarily, such as network issues or resource contention.
- **Message Queues**: When dealing with systems that might experience transient failures due to load spikes or temporary outages.
- **Microservices**: In distributed systems where a microservice might fail intermittently, and you want to gracefully handle such failures.
    

### **Example Usage of Polly**:

Here's an example of how you would use Polly to handle a transient failure in an HTTP request with retries and a circuit breaker.

1. **Install Polly**: To use Polly, you need to install the Polly NuGet package:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Polly
    ```
    
2. **Basic Example (Retry & Circuit Breaker)**:

```csharp
using Polly;
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();

        // Define a retry policy (retry 3 times with a 2-second delay)
        var retryPolicy = Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .WaitAndRetryAsync(3, attempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2), 
                (exception, timeSpan, retryCount, context) =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Retry {retryCount} due to: {exception.Message}");
                });

        // Define a circuit breaker policy (break the circuit after 2 failures)
        var circuitBreakerPolicy = Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .CircuitBreakerAsync(2, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), 
                onBreak: (exception, timeSpan) =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Circuit breaker triggered: {exception.Message}");
                },
                onReset: () =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Circuit breaker reset.");
                });

        // Combine retry and circuit breaker policies
        var policyWrap = Policy.WrapAsync(retryPolicy, circuitBreakerPolicy);

        try
        {
            // Execute the HTTP request within the policy wrap
            var response = await policyWrap.ExecuteAsync(() => httpClient.GetAsync("https://example.com"));
            Console.WriteLine($"Response: {response.StatusCode}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Request failed: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:

- **Retry Policy**: The `retryPolicy` will attempt to retry a failed operation (in this case, an HTTP request) up to 3 times, waiting 2 seconds between each retry.
- **Circuit Breaker Policy**: The `circuitBreakerPolicy` will break the circuit after 2 consecutive failures, meaning that it will stop attempting the operation for 10 seconds, preventing further failures.
- **Policy.WrapAsync**: This allows combining multiple policies. In this example, both retry and circuit breaker policies are combined, so the operation will first retry and, if it continues to fail, it will trigger the circuit breaker.
    
### **Advanced Features**:

- **Fallback**: You can specify fallback logic when an operation fails, such as returning a cached value or a default response.
    
    Example of Fallback:
- 
    ```csharp
    var fallbackPolicy = Policy
        .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
        .FallbackAsync(async (cancellationToken) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Returning default response due to failure.");
            return new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
            {
                Content = new StringContent("Fallback response")
            };
        });
    
    var response = await fallbackPolicy.ExecuteAsync(() => httpClient.GetAsync("https://example.com"));
    ```
    
- **Bulkhead Isolation**: Limits the number of concurrent executions of an operation, preventing resource exhaustion.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    var bulkheadPolicy = Policy.BulkheadAsync(5, 10); // max 5 concurrent executions, 10 total allowed
    ```
    

### **Benefits of Using Polly**:

1. **Improved Resilience**: Polly allows you to handle transient faults and network issues in a more graceful manner, making your application more resilient.
2. **Composability**: You can combine multiple policies (retry, circuit breaker, fallback, etc.) to create robust error handling logic tailored to your needs.
3. **Granularity**: Polly gives you precise control over how and when to retry or fail, enabling tailored behavior for specific operations.
4. **Simple Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing .NET projects, especially those involving HTTP requests or other external dependencies.

### **When to Use Polly**:

- When you're dealing with transient failures in **network calls**, **database connections**, **external APIs**, or **microservices**.
- If you need to build a more **fault-tolerant application** with automatic retries, fallback mechanisms, or circuit breakers.
- For applications with a lot of **asynchronous operations** that may occasionally fail due to load spikes or intermittent issues.

Polly helps ensure your application is robust in the face of failures and reduces the likelihood of cascading failures or repeated downtime.
