The achievement system, similar to the [[Quest System]], allows the player to earn rewards and recognition for completing specific goals or objectives within the game. Achievements can range from simple tasks, such as reaching a certain level or collecting a certain number of items, to more complex challenges, like defeating powerful enemies or completing difficult quests.
