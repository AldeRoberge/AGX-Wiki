### Why OpenTelemetry?

In the world of observability, big players like Datadog and New Relic offer nice solutions, but at a premium. SigNoz is a free and open source solution, but I had little luck setting it up.





#### What is OpenTelemetry (OTEL)?
A tool set, open observability framework for instrumenting, collecting and exporting telemetry data such as metrics, traces, logs and profiling.

Types of Telemetry Data:

- Traces: Capture the path and duration of requests as they flow through services, helping understand latency and dependencies.
- Metrics: Numeric measurements over time, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or request counts
- Logs: Record discrete events with contextual information.
  
### How Grafana Unifies These Tools:

1. Prometheus – Monitors and collects metrics.
2. Loki – Handles log aggregation.
3. Jaeger / Zipkin – Provides distributed tracing.


Grafana – Acts as the central UI for visualizing and correlating metrics, logs, and traces**



### What about .NET Aspire?
- .NET Aspire Dashboard is not meant for production (or is it? I get mixed signals
- [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone?tabs=bash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone?tabs=bash)
- The Aspire dashboard is limited in production because it has no storage. It holds a fixed number of events in memory.
