Linking your Discord account to your [[Other/Player/index|Alien Garden player account]] has many benefits. In game, you receive a code that you can paste in the Discord server. It allows you to link your account to the game. Once linked, you receive a special member role that gives you access to participate in the chests, gifts and coin flip [[Events]]. 

You will have access to server commands : 
* /profile - See your profile 
* /balance - See your balance
* /coinflip - Start a coinflip

See [[Commands]] for more information.
