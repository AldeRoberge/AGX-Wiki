I like .NET Aspire to easily setup and be quickly familiar with a code-first approach to configure dependencies.

From the .NET Aspire [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/deployment/overview#deploy-to-kubernetes) : 
```
Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform that can run .NET Aspire projects. To deploy .NET Aspire projects to Kubernetes clusters, you need to map the .NET Aspire JSON manifest to a Kubernetes YAML manifest file. There are two ways to do this: by using the Aspir8 project, or by manually creating Kubernetes manifests.
```

They mention that Aspir8 can be used to generate a Kubernetes manifest. It can also generate a Docker-Compose file, but does not support secrets.

Secrets are supported
