I chose Obsidian for this wiki because it offers advantages over other solutions : 

Paid solutions can be slow, unstable and unsecure. Obsidian is 'just markdown', which is very reliable and impossible to break. It is not a proprietary format or solely hosted in the cloud.

Google Docs was a very promising alternative for note taking, but had some limitations, since it's a proprietary format and can't be exported to a website like Obsidian can, with Quartz.

There was also SiYuan and Outline
