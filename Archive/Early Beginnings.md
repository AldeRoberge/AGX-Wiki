When I was a kid, I found a copy of _RollerCoaster Tycoon 2_ inside a cereal box. I had no idea what I was about to experience, but from the moment I launched the game, I was hooked.

The colors, the sounds, the sheer power of controlling an entire amusement park—it was magical. I wasn’t just playing a game; I was creating a world. And I loved it.

Fast forward to high school. My friends and I discovered _MinecraftForFree.com_, and suddenly, an entirely new kind of creative freedom opened up to me. A vast, procedurally generated world where I could build anything I wanted? I was in love.

I spent hours getting lost in underground caves, constructing impossible structures, and surviving the night. There was something truly special about _Minecraft_—a world of endless possibilities, waiting to be shaped by my imagination.

Then came _Realm of the Mad God_—a small, chaotic Flash game my friend introduced me to. Unlike anything I had played before, it combined MMO elements with bullet-hell combat and a brutal perma-death system.

Everything was at stake. If you died, you lost everything. And I _loved_ it.

Hours upon hours were spent grinding for loot, dodging through enemy fire, and celebrating with friends after a successful boss fight.

By this point, I wasn’t just playing games—I wanted to _understand_ them. I wanted to push past the limits the developers had set.

I had heard rumors that _Realm of the Mad God_ could be hacked, and curiosity got the best of me.

At first, I did the dumbest thing possible—I scammed people. "Give me your email and password, and I’ll give you hacks." And shockingly… it worked. The game had zero security. Thousands of credentials rolled in, and for a moment, it felt like I had discovered a secret world of unlimited power.

But then, reality hit me. This wasn’t hacking—it was just stealing. And that wasn’t what I wanted.

Determined to learn something _real_, I found my way onto MPGH.net, the hub for _Realm of the Mad God_ modders. That’s where I met some actual hackers—The Force 2477.

They had something legendary: a method to _duplicate_ any item in the game. Unlimited power.

I begged them to let me in. And one day, they did. They sent me a file: **TheSource.zip**.

Inside was a Java project for a headless client—a bot that could automate actions inside the game.

There was just one problem.

I knew absolutely nothing about programming.

I opened Eclipse, loaded up the code, and had no idea what I was looking at. But I wasn’t about to stop there. I dove into [_TheNewBoston_](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) tutorials, spending every day after school watching, pausing, rewinding, and writing code until it finally started to make sense.

Soon, I wasn’t just copying—I was creating.

I made bots that automatically looted rare items. I hosted _drop parties_, where I let random players grab the spoils. I learned how to decompile code, reverse-engineer mechanics, and truly understand how the game functioned.

And for the first time, I thought to myself:

_"What if I made my own game?"_

I kept learning. I discovered how _Realm of the Mad God_’s traffic was intercepted through proxy software like [_RealmRelay_](https://github.com/rotmg-tools/Realm-Relay) and [_KRelay_](https://github.com/Audetas/KRelay). I studied how the game communicated with the server, how packets were sent and received.

Then, I found out about private servers—people who had completely _rebuilt_ the game from the ground up. They could modify anything: new bosses, new weapons, even entirely new mechanics.

That’s when I realized—if _RollerCoaster Tycoon_ was made by one guy (Chris Sawyer), if _Minecraft_ started with just Notch, and if _Realm of the Mad God_ was built by two dudes (Alex and Rob)…

How hard could it be?

At this point, my obsession with making things had only grown.

What was once _GameMaker_ became _Unity_. What was once _Windows Movie Maker_ became _DaVinci Resolve_. The tools evolved, but the passion stayed the same.

Four years ago, I was flipping through a gardening encyclopedia before bed, admiring the beautiful images. And for some reason… it reminded me of _RollerCoaster Tycoon_.

I grabbed a notebook and started scribbling.

_"What if I combined _RollerCoaster Tycoon_, _Minecraft_, and _Realm of the Mad God_… and turned it into a bullet-hell gardening survival game?"_

And that was it. That was the moment.

That’s the game I’m making.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. I hope this brought back some nostalgia, or maybe even sparked an idea for your own project.

Because in the end, making games isn’t easy.

But when you have a vision—and the drive to chase it—it’s absolutely worth it.
